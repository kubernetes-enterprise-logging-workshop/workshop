# Running Docker applications

Docker is a fundamental piece in the CloudNative ecosystem, the following steps will guide you to learn and run packaged applications as Docker images.

All images used in this article are public and available in our Docker Hub Organization called [KELW](https://hub.docker.com/u/kelw/)

## Step 1: Verify that Docker is running

```bash
$ docker version
Client:
 Version:      17.09.0-ce
 API version:  1.32
 Go version:   go1.8.3
 Git commit:   afdb6d4
 Built:        Tue Sep 26 22:42:45 2017
 OS/Arch:      linux/amd64
Cannot connect to the Docker daemon at unix:///var/run/docker.sock. Is the docker daemon running?
```

If the command shows an output similar to the one above, means that your Docker service is running

## **Step 2: Run a simple Docker image from the Public Registry**

Run our hello-world application located at kelw/hello-world:

```bash


```
